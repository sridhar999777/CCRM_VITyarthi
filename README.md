## ‚ú® Features

CCRM is built with a modular structure and provides a rich set of features accessible through an interactive menu:

* **üéì Student Management**:
    * Add, list, update, and deactivate student records.
    * Each student has a unique ID, registration number, name, email, status, and enrollment date/time.
    * Generate a detailed student profile and a full academic transcript, including GPA calculation.

* **üìö Course Management**:
    * Add, list, update, and deactivate courses.
    * Courses are defined by their code, title, credits, instructor, semester, and department.
    * Powerful search and filtering capabilities using the **Java Stream API** (filter by instructor, department, or semester).

* **üìù Enrollment & Grading**:
    * Enroll and unenroll students from courses with built-in business logic (e.g., maximum credits per semester).
    * Record student marks for courses, which automatically compute letter grades (S, A, B, etc.) and grade points.
    * Utilizes Java `Enum` types for robustly handling `Semester` and `Grade` data.

* **üíæ File Operations (NIO.2)**:
    * Import student and course data from simple `.csv` text files.
    * Export the current state of students, courses, and enrollments to `.csv` files.
    * **Timestamped Backups**: A backup command copies all exported data files into a timestamped folder for versioning.
    * **Recursive Utility**: Includes a utility function to recursively compute and display the total size of the backup directory.

* **üíª Interactive CLI Workflow**:
    * A user-friendly, menu-driven console for all operations.
    * Demonstrates a wide range of Java constructs, including enhanced `switch` statements, all major loop types (`while`, `do-while`, `for`, `enhanced-for`), and control flow statements (`break`, `continue`, labeled jump).

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Language**: Java (JDK 11 or newer)
* **Core APIs**:
    * Java Date/Time API (`java.time`)
    * Java Stream API
    * Java NIO.2 for modern file I/O (`java.nio.file`)
* **IDE**: Developed to be compatible with any modern Java IDE like Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, or Eclipse.

---

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

* **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 11 or higher.
* **A Java IDE**: Visual Studio Code (with the "Extension Pack for Java") is recommended for an easy setup.

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/CCRM.git](https://github.com/your-username/CCRM.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd CCRM
    ```

3.  **Open the project in your IDE:**
    * **Visual Studio Code**: Open the root `CCRM` folder (`File > Open Folder...`). Do **not** open the `src` folder directly.
    * **IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse**: Import the project as a new Java project from existing sources.

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1.  Once the project is open in your IDE, locate the main entry point:
    `src/com/ccrm/Main.java`

2.  Run the `Main.java` file. Most IDEs provide a simple "Run" button:
    * In VS Code, a "Run" link will appear above the `main` method.
    * In IntelliJ or Eclipse, you can right-click the file and select "Run 'Main.main()'".

3.  The application will start, and the main menu will be displayed in the integrated terminal.

### Quick Start Usage

The application includes a `preloadData()` function that automatically creates sample `students.csv` and `courses.csv` files in a `data/` directory.

* On first run, navigate to **Option 4: File Operations**.
* Select **Option 1: Import Students and Courses from CSV** to populate the application with sample data.
* You can now explore other features like listing students, enrolling them in courses, and generating transcripts.
