2.  In the File Operations menu, enter `1` to **Import Students and Courses from CSV**.
3.  The system will read from the `students.csv` and `courses.csv` files located in the `data/` directory and load the records.

### 2. Managing Students

This module handles all student-related tasks.

#### Adding a New Student
1.  From the main menu, enter `1` for **Student Management**.
2.  Enter `1` to **Add New Student**.

2.  Enter the **Student ID** of the student you wish to view (you can find this ID by listing all students first with option `2`).
3.  The application will display the student's profile information, followed by a formatted transcript of their enrolled courses, grades, and current GPA.

### 3. Managing Courses

This module allows you to view and filter course information.

1.  From the main menu, enter `3` for **Enrollment & Grading**.
2.  Enter `1` to **Enroll Student in a Course**.
3.  Enter the **Student ID** and the **Course Code** (e.g., `CS101`).

5.  The system will automatically calculate and assign a letter grade (S, A, B, etc.) and update the student's overall GPA.

### 5. Exporting and Backing Up Data

This module handles data persistence and recovery.

1.  From the main menu, enter `4` for **File Operations**.
2.  To save the current data, select option `2` to **Export All Data**. This will overwrite the `.csv` files in the `data/` directory with the current application state.
